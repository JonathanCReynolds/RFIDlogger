# RFIDlogger

Arduino code for an autonomous battery-powered RFID reader/logger

This code runs an autonomous, battery-powered RFID reader/logger designed for wildlife research purposes and based on Hobbytronics' Ardulog-RTC board.  The original context was to record visits of RFID-tagged and un-tagged squirrels to a feeder box, but the concept and code could be readily adapted to many other wildlife contexts and access or signalling contexts where mains electricity is not available.  A paper describing the hardware, componentry, and construction is in preparation.
